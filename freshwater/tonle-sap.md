### Food
- This is also a major part of the lakes allure. The Tonle Sap is a very productive system for locals, with two thirds of Cambodians eating fish from the Tonle sap everyday.

### Agriculture
- Furthermore,the farmland in the surrounding area is quite fertile, with nutrient-rich sediment form the Tonle Sap being deposited on the floodplain.

## Disadvantages
- Although, the Tonle Sap also brings many negatives to the area. 67% of the water  comes from the River Mekong - only 33% comes from upstream. This causes the Tonle Sap to periodically empty itself.
