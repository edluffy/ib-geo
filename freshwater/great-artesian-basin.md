# Great Artesian Basin
## Introduction
Groundwater sources such as Artesian Aquifers are important to human development as they provide a source of freshwater in many areas where there is no viable alternative. They are essentially made of layers of porous rock that hold vast amounts of water underground. The largest and deepest of these is called the Great Artesian basin - an underground store of over 64,000km cubed of water.

## Importance
> It is the only low-cost method of water extraction in much of rural mainland Australia. Underlying 23% of the continent, the pastoral community of Australian farmers rely on the basin for their livelihood.

## Problems
Recently, the basin has suffered from a drastic decrease in water volume, pressure and quality.
This is because, during the early 1900s and the onset of Australias farming industry, groundwater extraction was underegulated and unsustainable.
Many farmers did not recognise the importance of the basin as a primary water source
Over time, many of the thousand of wells in mainland Australia have begun to leak excess amounts of water due to old age.
- In 1915, there were over 1,500 bores providing 2,000 megalitres of water per day.

## Solutions
To solve this problem, the Australian governement has imposed a response plan to protect the remaining water.
- Resource management partnership have been established to accelerate change in the way water is extracted.
- Expanded infrastructure renewal programs began in 2007, repairing and removing old extraction wells.
- Management technology has also improved, with many of the existing extraction points being mapped and monitored for future leaks.

## Conclusion
Overall, the Australian commitee argues that the plan will be a success if 50% of the water extraction is saved (from 2007) and the Great Artesian basin is efficiently managed as a single water resource.
