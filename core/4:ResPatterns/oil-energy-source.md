# Examine the changing importance of oil as an energy source
## Introduction
In modern times, the consumption of fossil fuels such as oil has increased at an alarming rate. To keep up with the demand, production and extraction of oil has also exponentially increased. This has led to a variety of geopolitical and also environmental problems worldwide.
## Causes

### Consumption
- The global consumption of oil contains many disparities. Only seven countries account for more than 50% of all global demand.
- Oil consumption has nearly tripled since 1965.
- In 2006 demand was almost 84 million barrels per day.
- New oil demand is coming from emergin Asian economies, namely China.
### Production
- Half of oil production comes from the Middle East, Russia and North America.
- there is very little oil production in the whole of Africa.

## Problems
### Geopolitical
- The importance of the Middle east as a supplier has caused worldwide conflict such as the Gulf war in 1991.
- A group named OPEC (Organisation of Petroluem Exporting Countries) controls the price of crude oil closely.
- In order for their own interests, countries need to strive for political stability in the region.
### Environment
- Oil slicks such as the Gulf Sea oil spill have had a detrimental effect on the environment over time.
- They are harmful to local wildlife and have a profound effect on biodiversity.
- Oil rigs and platforms also have a substantial effect on the environment.
### Reserves
 - At present rates, reserves will last for another 40 years at best. World leaders need a sustainable plan in place for once this inevitable happens.
