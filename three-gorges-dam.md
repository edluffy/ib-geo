# Three Gorges Dam

## Introduction
>
With the recent worldwide focus on renewable energy sources, Hydroelectric dams - which control the flow of a river to produce electricity - are being built. One of the biggest examples is the Three Gorges Dam - now the largest powerstation in the world.
The Three Gorges Dam originally began construction in 1992, on a chokepoints of the River Yangtze. Only being finished recently in 2012, there are many benefits and disadvantages to its construction.

## Advantages
### Socio-economic
>
- The dam currently provides protection from 1 in a 100 year floods. This is vital in ensuring the livelihoods of people living in the Dongting Lake Plains.
### Economic
> 
- The dam provides 18,200 MW of Hydro-electric power. This is estimated to be about 10% of Chinas total electricity needs.
- The dam has improved the Chinese inland shipping system, Areas of the valley that were once out of reach for ships are now becoming major ports of trade.
- Water supply of towns in the valley has also improved.
### Environmental
>
- Reduced air pollution as HEP energy is mostly generated in a clean and safe way.

## Disadvantages
### Socio-economic
- At least 1.2 million people have been resettled due to controlled flooding when the dam was built - whole towns have disappeared.
- Some people living in the valleys have had to move to steeper areas with poorer soils.
- Cultural heritage has been destroyed. Over 1200 sites of cultural importance were drowned.
### Environmental
- Due to the dam blocking the flow of the river, sewage and industrial effluent have piled up in the reservoir.
- The famous Yangtze River Dolphin is now thought to be extinct due to loss of its habitat.
- Such a large-scale dam has slightly increased earthquake risk in the area.
